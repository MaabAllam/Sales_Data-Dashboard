# Sales_Data-Dashboard
This project is part of my ongoing journey to master Power BI and data analytics. I used a public dataset called **Sales_Data**, sourced from Kaggle, to build a comprehensive Power BI report with custom visualizations, calculated metrics, and clean data modeling.
🔍 Power BI Sales Data Analysis – Project Overview
As part of my continuous journey in Power BI and Data Analysis, I completed a comprehensive project using a publicly available dataset titled Sales_Data, sourced from Kaggle.

📥 Data Loading & Preparation
Using Power BI’s Get Data feature, I imported the dataset, which consisted of four CSV files. I utilized Power Query Editor to perform essential data transformation tasks, including:

Cleaning and validating the data

Handling missing values and inconsistencies

Ensuring correct data types

Checking for and managing table relationships

Deciding whether merging datasets was necessary

Once the data was prepared, I applied the changes and moved to the report view.

📊 Data Modeling & Table Enhancements
In the Model View, I verified and adjusted relationships between tables to ensure data integrity. I also explored the Table View to:

Create calculated columns where needed

Prepare tables for efficient analysis

📈 Visualizations & DAX Measures
Focusing on the Sales and Orders tables, I created key performance metrics using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), such as:

Profit = Revenue - Cost

Total Units Sold

Profit Margin

I visualized these KPIs using clear, intuitive charts to communicate insights effectively. The formulas applied ranged from basic aggregations to iterative functions, with additional filtering and time intelligence calculations integrated across the report.

Due to limitations with business email credentials, I’ve included screenshots of the dashboards to demonstrate the report’s structure and design.

🚀 This project strengthened my skills in:

Data cleaning & transformation

Data modeling

DAX for calculations and time intelligence

Creating dynamic, filterable visual reports in Power BI
